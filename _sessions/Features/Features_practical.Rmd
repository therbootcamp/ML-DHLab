## Overview

By the end of this practical you will:

1. Understand the importance of the curse of dimensionality.
2. Know how to eliminate unwanted features.
3. Explore and use feature importance.
4. Use dimensionality reduction.

## Tasks

### A - Setup

1. Open your `TheRBootcamp` R project. 

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `Features_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load `tidyverse` and `caret`.

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

4. Using the code below load the data sets used in this practical and turn all character into factor.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Pima Indians diabetes
pima_diabetes <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/pima_diabetes.csv") %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)

# murders crime statistics
murders_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/murders_crime.csv")%>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)

# (Non-) violent crime statistics
violent_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/violent_crime.csv")%>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)
nonviolent_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/nonviolent_crime.csv")%>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)
```


### B - Pima Indians Diabetes

In this section, you will explore feature selection for the Pima Indians Diabetes data set. The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. A genetic predisposition allowed this group to live well with a diet poor of carbohydrates for years. In the recent years, however, because of a sudden shift from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity, they developed a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. For this reason they have been subject of many studies. 

1. Print `pima_diabetes` to take a look and familiarize yourself with the data.

```{r}
pima_diabetes
```

#### Splitting

2. Before you begin, you need to separate the hold-out (test) data set for later. Create `pima_train` and `pima_test` using the `createDataPartition()` function. Set `p = .15` to select (only) <b>15% of cases for the training set</b>. The criterion is `diabetes`. See code below.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# seed
set.seed(100)

# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(XX$XX, p = .15, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
pima_train <- XX %>% slice(train_index)
pima_test  <- XX %>% slice(-train_index)

```

```{r}
# seed
set.seed(100)

# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(pima_diabetes$diabetes, p = .15, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
pima_train <- pima_diabetes %>% slice(train_index)
pima_test  <- pima_diabetes %>% slice(-train_index)

```

#### Remove unwanted features

OK, let's get to work and remove some features from the training data.

3. First split the training data into a data frame holding the predictors and a vector holding the criterion (`diabetes`) using the template below.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Select predictors
pima_train_pred <- pima_train %>% select(-XX)

# Select criterion
pima_train_crit <- pima_train %>% select(XX)
```

```{r}
# Select predictors
pima_train_pred <- pima_train %>% select(-diabetes)

# Select criterion
pima_train_crit <- pima_train %>% select(diabetes)
```

4. Although, use the template below to test whether there are any excessively correlated features using `cor()` and `findCorrelation()`. Are there any?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(XX_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

```{r}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(pima_train_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

5. Now, test if there are any near-zero variance features using the `nearZeroVar` function. Any of those?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(XX_pred)
```

```{r}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(pima_train_pred)
```

#### Feature importance

As there were no problems with the features in the data set, you have retained all of them. In this section, you will carry out feature selection on the grounds of feature importance. To do this, you first have to fit a model on the basis of which feature importance can be determined. How about a simple logistic regression using `method = "glm"`? 

6. Fit a `glm` model to the training data predicting `diabetes`. Call the model `pima_glm`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fit regression
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = XX,
                method = XX,
                trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))
```

```{r}
# fit regression
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = pima_train,
                method = "glm",
                trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))
```

7. Evaluate feature importance using `varImp()`. The function will show importance on a scale from 0 (least important feature) to 100 (most important feature). You can set `scale = TRUE` to see absolute importance measures scaled as *t*-values.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(XX)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

```{r}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(pima_glm)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

#### Model comparison

Now, create a second model using the best features and compare performances.

8. Fit the glm a second time, this time using only the four best features and store the result in a different fit object.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 <- train(diabetes ~ XX + YY + ZZ + AA,
                data = XX,
                method = XX)
```

```{r}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 <- train(diabetes ~ glucose + mass + pregnant + pressure,
                data = pima_train,
                method = "glm")
```

9. For both models, the glm using all and the glm using just four features, predict the criterion in the test data and evaluate the prediction performance using `confusionMatrix()`. Which model model is better?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
```

```{r}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(pima_glm, newdata = pima_test)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(pima_glm4, newdata = pima_test)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(pima_glm_pred, pima_test$diabetes)
confusionMatrix(pima_glm4_pred, pima_test$diabetes)
```

10. You should have observed that the model with two fewer features is actually slightly better than the full model. Why do you think this is the case?

11. Play around: Increase the proportion of data dedicated to training or use a different model, e.g., `random forest`, and see whether things change. 

### C - Murders

Now explore feature selection using a different data set. The data used in this section combines socio-economic data from the US '90 Census, data from Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the FB. The gaol is to predict `murders` (the criterion in this section).   

1. Print `murders_crime` and familiarize yourself with the data.

```{r}
murders_crime
```

#### Splitting

2. Create `murders_train` and `murders_test` using `createDataPartition()` with (only) <b>25% of cases going into the training set</b>.

```{r}
# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(murders_crime$murders, p = .25, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
murders_train <- murders_crime %>% slice(train_index)
murders_test  <- murders_crime %>% slice(-train_index)
```

#### Remove unwanted features

3. Before removing unwanted features from the training set, split the training data into predictors and the criterion in the same way you have done this above.

```{r}
# Select predictors
murders_train_pred <- murders_train %>% select(-murders)

# Select criterion
murders_train_crit <- murders_train %>% select(murders)
```

4. Test if there are any excessively correlated features using `cor()` and `findCorrelation()`. Are there any this time?

```{r}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(murders_train_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

5. Using the code below, remove the excessively correlated features from the training predictor set.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# remove features
murders_train_pred <- murders_train_pred %>% select(- XX)
```

```{r}
# remove features
murders_train_pred <- murders_train_pred %>% 
  select(-findCorrelation(corr_matrix))
```

6. Test if there are any near-zero variance features. Any of those this time?

```{r}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(murders_train_pred)
```

7. You should have found that there were plenty of excessively correlated features but no near-zero variance features. Provided that you excluded the former, bind the reduced predictor set back together with the criterion into a new, clean version of the training set. See template below.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# clean training set
murders_train_clean <- XX %>% 
  bind_cols(XX)
```

```{r}
# combine clean predictor set with criterion
murders_train_clean <- murders_train_pred %>% 
  bind_cols(murders_train_crit)
```

#### Model comparison

8. Let us find out whether excluding some of the highly correlated features matters. Fit a `glm` twice, once using the original training set and once using the clean training set, and store the fits in separate objects. See template below.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fit glm
murders_glm <- train(murders ~ .,
                     data = XX,
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))

# fit glm with clean data
murders_glm_clean <- train(murders ~ .,
                           data = XX,
                           method = "glm",
                           trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))
```

```{r}
# fit glm
murders_glm <- train(murders ~ .,
                     data = murders_train,
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))

# fit glm with clean data
murders_glm_clean <- train(murders ~ .,
                           data = murders_train_clean,
                           method = "glm",
                           trControl = trainControl(method = 'none'))
```

9. You probably have noticed warning messages. They could indicate that the features in both data sets, but especially the non-clean set, are still too highly correlated. Go ahead nonetheless and evaluate the performance on the hold-out set. Which set of features predicts better?

```{r}
# determine predictions for test data
murders_pred <- predict(murders_glm, newdata = murders_test)
murders_clean_pred <- predict(murders_glm_clean, newdata = murders_test)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(murders_pred, murders_test$murders)
confusionMatrix(murders_clean_pred, murders_test$murders)
```

#### Data compression with PCA

10. Given the high features correlations, it could be sensible to compress the data using `principal component analysis` (PCA). Create a third glm model using the original, full training set and this time add `preProcess = c('pca')` and `preProcOptions = list(thresh = 0.8)` in `trControl`. These additional settings instruct caret to extract new features from the data using PCA and to retain only as many features as are needed to capture 80% of the original variance. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# fit glm with preprocessed features
murders_glm_pca = train(murders ~ .,
                        data = murders_train,
                        method = "glm",
                        preProcess = c("pca"),
                        trControl = trainControl(method = 'none',
                                                 preProcOptions = list(thresh = 0.8)))
```

11. Compare the prediction performance to the previous two models. 

```{r}
# determine predictions for test data
murders_pca <- predict(murders_glm_pca, newdata = murders_test)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(murders_pca, murders_test$murders)
```

12. Play around: Alter the amount of variance explained by the `PCA` (using `thresh`), increase the proportion dedicated to training, use a different model, e.g., `random forest`, and see whether things change. 

#### Feature importance

13. Now find out which features are actually most important for predicting murders. Using `varImp()`, evaluate the feature importance for each of the three models used in the previous section. 

```{r}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(murders_glm)
varimp_glm_clean <- varImp(murders_glm_clean)
varimp_glm_pca <- varImp(murders_glm_pca)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm
varimp_glm_clean
varimp_glm_pca

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
plot(varimp_glm_clean)
plot(varimp_glm_pca)


```

14. Now that you know which features were most important, do you think you can come up with a set of features that reliably outperforms thew predictions based on the pca-generated feature set? Try it out!


### Z - Violent & Non-violent Crime Data

1. Analyze the violent and non-violent crime data sets predicting either the number of violent crimes per 100k inhabitants (`ViolentCrimesPerPop`) or the number of non-violent crimes per 100k inhabitants (`nonViolPerPop`). Both criteria are numeric, implying that this is not classification problem, but one of regression. Other than that, the features in the data set are identical to the previous analyses. How well can you predict violent or non-violent crimes?

2. Another approach to feature selection, beyond selection by hand or PCA, is to have the computer try to automically select subsets of features that lead to the best possible cross-validation performance. One such process is called recursive feature elimination. Try it out using `caret`'s  `rfe()` function. See code below. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = F}

# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(violent_crime$ViolentCrimesPerPop, 
                                   p = .8, 
                                   list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
violent_train <- violent_crime %>% slice(train_index)
violent_test  <- violent_crime %>% slice(-train_index)

# remove extreme correlations (OPTIONAL)
predictors <- violent_train %>% select(-ViolentCrimesPerPop)
predictors <- predictors %>% select(-findCorrelation(cor(predictors)))
violent_train_clean <- predictors %>%
  add_column(ViolentCrimesPerPop = violent_train$ViolentCrimesPerPop)

# Feature elimination settings 
ctrl_rfe <- rfeControl(functions = lmFuncs,  # linear model
                          method = "cv",
                          verbose = FALSE,
                          rerank = FALSE)

# Run feature elimination
profile <- rfe(x = violent_train %>% select(-ViolentCrimesPerPop), 
               y = violent_train$ViolentCrimesPerPop,
               sizes = 1:(ncol(violent_train_clean)-1), # Features set sizes
               rfeControl = ctrl_rfe)

# inspect cross-validation as a function of performance
plot(profile)
```
